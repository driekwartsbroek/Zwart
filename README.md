# Zwart - A Qbit Web Viewer Client

## Overview

**Zwart** is a rough first version of a clean, simple, and modern web interface designed for casual torrenting. The goal is to provide an intuitive and minimalistic user experience, making it easy to manage torrents without unnecessary clutter.

This project is very much in its early stages, so expect a few rough edges. However, I encourage others to build on it, extend its capabilities, and improve the codebase.

## Features

- **Simple and Clean UI**: A focus on straightforward navigation, making torrent management easy and accessible.
- **Modern Design**: Built with modern web design principles in mind, keeping the interface fresh and responsive.
- **Casual Torrenting**: Tailored for users who want a hassle-free experience for handling torrents.

## Contributing

If you're a developer and feel inspired to contribute, I'd love to see where the community can take this project! Please feel free to fork, improve, and suggest new features. 

As a **UX designer** by trade, I can definitely help from a design standpoint, so feel free to reach out for collaboration on the user experience side. However, just a soft disclaimerâ€”I am not a coder, so my focus has been primarily on the design aspects of this project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Start the development server and explore the interface.

I look forward to seeing how Zwart evolves with the help of the open-source community!
